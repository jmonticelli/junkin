# Junkin

Junkin is a minimalist gray item selling addon targeted for World of Warcraft Classic players. Its goal was to provide the simplest way to sell poor quality items to vendors while not automatically selling them.

Current version: 1.0.0

## Commands
```
- /junkin sell      Sell all gray items
- /junkin help      Get a help menu similar
- /junkin version   Get current version + contact information
```

## Future work

- Planning on setting up a configurable autosell
- Debating adding item sell whitelists
- Perhaps create profiles
- Maybe work with Auctioneer and other addons to autosell if (AH value + deposit cost) is less than item
- Work on confirmation
